1. **Create a systemd Service File:**

   Create a new systemd service file for your script. You can place this file in the `/etc/systemd/system/` directory with a `.service` extension, such as `/etc/systemd/system/my-script.service`. Use your preferred text editor to create and edit the file. Here's an example:

   ```plaintext
   [Unit]
   Description=My Script Description

   [Service]
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/script.py
   User=root
   Group=root
   Restart=on-failure

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

   - Replace `/path/to/your/script.py` with the actual path to your Python script.
   - Customize the `Description` field to describe your service.

2. **Reload systemd:**

   After creating the service file, you need to reload the systemd manager to pick up the new service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

3. **Enable and Start the Service:**

   To enable the service to start at boot, use the following commands:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable my-script.service
   ```

   Replace `my-script.service` with the name you gave to your service file.

4. **Start the Service:**

   You can start the service immediately with:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start my-script.service
   ```

   This will execute your script with `sudo` privileges.

5. **Check the Service Status:**

   You can check the status of the service to ensure it's running and see any potential errors:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status my-script.service
   ```

Now, your script should run at boot as `sudo`. If you need to stop or restart it manually, you can use `systemctl stop my-script.service` or `systemctl restart my-script.service`.
